    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrency offers a number of benefits, including the ability to securely and transparently make and receive payments, as well as the ability to store and transfer value without the need for a central authority. Customers that need to swap cryptocurrency in a decentralised (DEX) way are the target audience for this app. <a class="link" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/AlNa7zwerm5fH06WfgcjQs/Quarks?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=93%3A356">View the prototype here.</a> </p>

    <h2>Why I Choose this project.</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are now a big topic in modern world, with some claiming they will eventually replace money. I thus choose to participate in this technology. Cryptos have greater power when used decentralizedly. DEXs, or decentralised exchanges, are peer-to-peer markets where cryptocurrency traders may conduct transactions without entrusting the administration of their assets to a middleman or custodian. <br> <br> Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts written in computer code, are used to expedite these transactions. DEXs were developed to do away with the need for any authority to monitor and approve deals executed within a particular exchange.</p>
    <img class="fit" src="/images/why.png">

   <h2>Problem</h2>
   <p>How might we make the user interface easier to use so that users may exchange their cryptocurrencies in a decentralised exchange wallet? DEXs can encourage more user participation.</p>

    <h2 id="research">Goals</h2>
    <p>1. Allow people to keep their cryptocurrency coins.<br>
    2. Users may easily check the market data's past performance, learn more about it, and follow a coin's transactions..<br>
    3. Options for importing an old wallet into a new device.</p>






<h2 >User Research</h2>
<p>I first sent a survey to three user groups: experienced cryptocurrency traders, frequent wallet users, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts who aren't totally immersed in the currency. Find out whether they are exchanging cryptocurrency on CEX or DEX. There are issues with the apps they use.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/Re.png">

    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <p>1. Users are dissatisfied with the existing backup method in other apps.<br>
    2.  Due to backup problems, users have lost access to their wallets.<br>
    3. DEXs are not user-friendly for beginners and are better suited for traders who have experience in the cryptocurrency market due to their lack of intuitiveness. <br>
4. The majority of DEX wallets don't offer a simple way to monitor transactions or activity. <br>
5. In order to keep their assets separate from their families, customers choose to have multiple wallets within a single app. They may also utilise it like bank applications by having many accounts for various purposes.</p>


<h2 id="Per">Personas</h2>
<p>Personas are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.</p>
    <img class="fit" src="/images/F22 2.png">

<h2 id="Pro">Problem statement</h2>
<p>Identifying the problems that users face is one of the most important parts of UX design. It is imperative to have a problem-solution fit. We ensured that by starting with clear problem statements for our primary personas.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/wtf9.png">

<h2 id="Big">Big picture story board</h2>
<p>Storyboard is a series of panels or frames that visually describes and explores a user's experience with a product.
    To further empathise with users and see a bigger picture of the process we created many big-picture storyboards. Each storyboard represented a major user-flow.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/Story.png">

<h2 id="Wir">Wireframe</h2>
<p>In order to arrange content and functionality on a page while taking into account user demands and user journeys, a wireframe is frequently used. Before adding visual design and content to a page, the basic framework of the page is established using wireframes early in the development process.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/wwwf.png">



<h2 id="Inf">Information Architecture </h2>
<p>Information architecture (IA) is, like a blueprint, a visual representation of the product's infrastructure, features, and hierarchy. The level of detail is up to the designer, so IA may also include navigation, application functions and behaviors, content, and flows.</p>

<img class="fit" src="/images/FFF.png">


<h2 id="nextsteps">Next steps</h2>
<p>1. Perform a usability study to confirm whether the problems users encountered have been successfully resolved.<br>
2.  Perform user research to identify any new areas to improve.<br>
3. Implement further customizations</p>



<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I use cryptocurrency applications and I have some of it myself, but I'm still not really clear on how it works. I've always had to get in touch with other cryptocurrency users to get clarification, which is what inspired me to build this. The project was extremely challenging to work on. It takes days to fully understand the issue. I'm very happy I finally completed this project.</p>
