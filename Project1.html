    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>Cake cutting is a common tradition at many celebrations, including weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries. It is typically done as a symbolic gesture to mark a special occasion and is often accompanied by a toast or other expressions of good wishes. This app target customers who need to order cake immediately and  delivery the cake on their doorstep with scheduling. <a class="link" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/go2IepDicaDLG9BFuoSe3H/Vola-Cake?node-id=724%3A494&scaling=scale-down&page-id=367%3A2152&starting-point-node-id=702%3A4">View the prototype here.</a> </p>

   <h2>Problem</h2>
   <p>Busy workers and commuters who needs to 
    celebrate events by cake cutting and who 
    forget order cake in special events.</p>

    <h2 id="research">Goals</h2>
    <p>1. Design a Cake ordering app that allows users 
        to easily order cakes<br>
    2.  Orders must deliver immediately and deliver 
    on speciffic date and time.<br>
    3. UI must be simple as accessible.</p>






<h2 >User Research</h2>
<p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I'm
    designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research
    was working adults who need cake for immediate celebrations on their doorstep.
    This user group confirmed initial assumptions about Cake Factory App, but research
    also revealed that time was not the only factor limiting users who needs to order immediately. 
    Other user problems included physically abled who can't go outside,  Persons who don't know how
    to handle cake, who needs to surprise even they are distance.</p>

    <h2>Pain points</h2>
    <p>1. Working Adults and 
        Students who often
        think about cake when 
        involved in sudden
        celebration.<br>
    2.  People who orders 
    special Big Layering 
    cakes. But they don't 
    know how to handle
    without Damage.<br>
    3. People who need to 
    order cake before and 
    scheduling their orders 
    on right Day and Time.</p>

<h2 id="Per">Personas</h2>
<p>Prakash is a Student 
    who needs  to order cake 
    on Sudden Celebration 
    and deliver on require 
    Location. So they can 
    make surprise others 
    and enjoy.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/po.png" alt="sketches">

<h2 id="Use">User journey map</h2>
<p>Mapping Prakash's user 
    journey revealed how 
    helpful it would be for users 
    to have access to order 
    cake from the Cake Factory 
    app.</p>
<img id="prototype" class="fit" src="/images/map1.png" alt="sketches">


<h2 id="Pap">Paper wireframe</h2>
<p>Taking the time to draft 
    iterations of each screen of 
    the app on paper ensured 
    that the elements that 
    made it to digital 
    wireframes would be 
    well-suited to address user 
    pain points. For the home 
    screen, I prioritized a quick 
    and easy ordering process 
    to help users save time.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/wf11.png" alt="sketches">

<h2 id="Dig">Digital wireframe</h2>
<p>As the initial design phase 
    continues, I made sure to 
    base screen designs on 
    feedback and findings from 
    the user research.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/Dw.PNG" alt="sketches">

<h2 id="Low">Low-ﬁdelity prototype</h2>
<p>Using the completed set of digital 
    wireframes, I created a
    low-ﬁdelity prototype. The 
    primary user ﬂow I connected 
    was building and ordering a Cake, 
    so the prototype could be used in 
    a usability study.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/lf1.PNG" alt="sketches">

<h2 id="Usa">Usability study: ﬁndings</h2>
<p>1.  User want to add name on cake<br>
2.  Don't need two pages for ingredients 
and review.<br>
3.  Need sidebar for better navigation.</p>

<h2 id="Moc">Mockups</h2>
<p>In Early designs, I set every 
    options in sidebar. After 
    usability study. I designed 
    Bottom bars and 
    separated the options for 
    easy navigation.</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/Frame 11.png" alt="sketches">

<p>The second usability study 
    revealed the frustration of 
    navigating Reviews and 
    Ingredients section. I 
    Designed Ingridents are 
    vertically aligned and 
    Reviews are Horizontally 
    aligned.</p>
    <img class="fit" src="/images/Frame 22.png" alt="sketches">


<h2 id="">Key Mockups</h2>

<img class="fit" src="/images/keymo.PNG" alt="sketches">

<h2 id="Hig">High-ﬁdelity 
    prototype</h2>
<p>The ﬁnal high-ﬁdelity 
    prototype presented cleaner 
    user ﬂows for Scheduling 
    orders and checkout, and 
    more payment options added..</p>
<img class="fit" src="/images/hf.PNG" alt="sketches">

<h2 id="nextsteps">Next steps</h2>
<p>1. Conduct another 
    round of usability 
    studies to validate 
    whether the pain
    points users 
    experienced have 
    been effectively
    addressed.<br>
2.  Conduct more user 
research to determine
any new areas of
need..<br>
3. Implement further customizations</p>



<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>It was my first project. In order to tackle these challenges, I had to learn a lot of new stuff. I pushed myself to come up with several variations and do user testing. I took advantage of our volunteer community to ask for feedback proactively.</p>
